Answers to HW8 Questions
========================

a)  How to detect when a page is accessed?
To detect when a page is accessed we can set all the permissions to PROT_NONE
using mprotect(). Thus, when access is attempted for a page there will be a
segfault and we can then change the accessed flag and change the permission to
PROT_READ.

b)  How to detect when a page becomes dirty?
Similar to part (a), if one tries to write to a page that has the
PROT_READ flag there will be a segfault and the dirty flag can be changed and
the permission can be changed to PROT_READ and PROT_WRITE.

f)  Page-load rate of "test_matrix -m 1024 1000" using RANDOM policy: ~54,000


g)  Page Replacement Policy #1 (fill in the information below)

Name of policy you chose to implement: The FIFO Policy

Below, give the command-line for invoking the matrix-test program for a
1000x1000 matrix, with a maximum of 1024 resident pages.  (If multiple
steps are required, list them all here.)

  >>> test_matrix_fifo -m 1024 1000

Give the resulting page-load rate of the above command: 47,944


h)  Page Replacement Policy #2 (if you implemented two policies)

Name of policy you chose to implement: The CLOCK/LRU Policy

Below, give the command-line for invoking the matrix-test program for a
1000x1000 matrix, with a maximum of 1024 resident pages.  (If multiple
steps are required, list them all here.)

  >>> test_matrix_clru -m 1024 1000

Give the resulting page-load rate of the above command: 6,835
