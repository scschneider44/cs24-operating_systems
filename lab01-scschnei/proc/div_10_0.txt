When running the divider.ibits with div_10_0.rbits we run into a problem where
we have an infinite loop. This is because our dividing function works by
continually subtracting the dividend by the divisor. Subtracting by 0 means
that the remainder will never decrease, so the statement to break out of the
while loop will never be reached. Thus, we get an infinite loop.
